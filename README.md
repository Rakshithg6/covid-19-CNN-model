# COVID-19 Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository hosts a comprehensive deep learning project focused on the detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is designed to assist in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze medical imaging data.

## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for fast and reliable diagnostic tools. This project aims to contribute to these efforts by developing a CNN-based model that can automatically classify chest X-ray images as either COVID-19 positive or negative. The model is trained on a curated dataset of X-ray images, with the goal of aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Key Features

CNN Architecture: The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network, a deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The network is designed to capture complex patterns in medical images, enabling the differentiation between COVID-19 and other conditions.

Data Preprocessing: The repository includes scripts for preprocessing chest X-ray images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation. These steps ensure that the images are in an optimal format for training and improve the model's generalization capabilities.

Model Training and Validation: The CNN model is trained on a diverse set of chest X-ray images labeled for COVID-19. The training process is carefully monitored using validation techniques to prevent overfitting and to ensure robust performance. Detailed training logs and metrics are provided to track the model’s progress.

Performance Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are also generated to provide insights into the model’s classification abilities. These metrics help in understanding the model’s strengths and areas for improvement.

Interpretability and Explainability: Understanding how a deep learning model makes its decisions is crucial, especially in a healthcare setting. This project incorporates interpretability techniques, such as Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), to visualize the regions of X-ray images that the model focuses on when making predictions. These visualizations are invaluable for clinicians who need to trust the model’s outputs.
